BetterQuesting
============

A new and improved questing mod for Minecraft pack creators

---

This fork is a continuation of Better Questing for Minecraft 1.12.2 from where @Funwayguy stopped development.

The aim of this fork is to provide various improvements and bugfixes over the final state of the mod.

As such, this mod integrates the various addon packs into one main mod, to provide a full-featured experience in a single mod.

- @fonnymunkey for various feature from BQTweaker, now integrated to provide a better experience.
